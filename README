Folder 'bin' contains the executables and the DunGen.lib file.
Folder 'documentation' contains the doxygen documentation.

Folder 'RandomCaves' contains the code and Visual Studio 2010 project for the tool to create caves from random L-systems.
Folder 'TutorialXY' contains the code and Visual Studio 2010 project for the DunGen-Tutorial XY.

Note: You probably have to adapt the Irrlicht include and library folder within the projects, if you want to compile them by yourself.

To use DunGen, you have to:
a) to add the 'DunGen.lib' file, so add 'bin' to you library folders
b) to add the 'DunGen\interface' folder to your include folders
c) have the 'DunGen.dll' in the folder where your project executable is running
